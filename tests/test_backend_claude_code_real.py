# Under the VM0-shape backend (--dangerously-skip-permissions + the
# built-in AUQ disabled via --disallowedTools), AUQ no longer flows
# through the CLI control protocol. The model uses the
# `mcp__ask__user` MCP tool instead, which calls back into the
# Owlery FastAPI process over HTTP. Verifying that round-trip needs
# a live uvicorn + REST + frontend submission; it's covered by the
# Playwright e2e (`web/e2e/new-features.spec.ts`), not by a backend
# unit test. Keeping a unit test here would just mock the entire
# host out and prove nothing.
