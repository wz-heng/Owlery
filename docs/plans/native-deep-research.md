# Owlery-native deep research

> **Implementation status: SHIPPED.** The full pipeline described in this plan
> is implemented and running: `server/research/` (manager, orchestrator, leaf
> executor, schemas), `server/routers/research.py`, `server/mcp_servers/research.py`,
> and the `ResearchCard` frontend component. The `research_jobs` table is in the
> schema. The §1a prerequisites (process-group reaping, tool-policy renderer) were
> resolved as part of the turn-safety and harness work. This doc now serves as
> design reference; the §9 test suite is in `tests/test_research*.py` and
> `web/e2e/research.spec.ts`.

## 1. Why native (not the harness skill)

The Claude Code `/deep-research` skill is a background, multi-agent
**Workflow** that fans out dozens of subagents and relies on the interactive
Claude harness's workflow runtime + completion-notification. Run inside
Owlery's one-shot headless `claude --print` turn it (a) never streams a
terminal result so the turn hangs, and (b) is Claude-only — Codex has no
equivalent. Owlery is a **harness-agnostic** agent platform, so research
orchestration belongs at the Owlery layer, the same way connectors,
schedules, bg-tasks and delegations do. We own the fan-out, the limits, the
progress, the cancellation, and the persistence — and it works identically on
claude-code and codex.

## 1a. Prerequisites — resolved before ship

Two harness-layer concerns were addressed before research shipped:

1. **Per-turn lifecycle / process-group reaping ("Layer 1").** `HarnessRun`
   spawns without `start_new_session=True` (`run.py:225`) and `stop()` only
   kills the direct child (`run.py:270`); `run_oneshot` likewise just
   `proc.kill()`s. Every research leaf is another real harness subprocess
   (Claude's web sub-turn itself may spawn children), so we need: own process
   group + `killpg`, a per-turn idle/overall timeout, and a heartbeat — applied
   to BOTH the streaming run and `run_oneshot`. bg_tasks already does process
   groups (`bg_tasks.py:252,593`); reuse that.
2. **A backend tool-policy renderer.** Claude maps `tool_allow` →
   `--allowedTools` (`claude_code.py:206`), but **codex `build_turn_argv`
   ignores `ctx.tool_allow`/`tool_deny` entirely** (`codex.py:129`). So the
   "restricted to web + read-only" leaf contract is NOT backend-agnostic today.
   Codex needs a profile-level tool-policy + web-enable renderer (emit
   `-c tools.web_search=true` and enforce the allow/deny set) before research
   leaves run on codex; until then codex research is gated off.

## 2. The layering (this is the whole idea)

We do NOT build web search/fetch — that's a product in itself (ranking,
freshness, anti-bot, JS rendering, extraction) and a maintenance sink. Web
access comes from the **harness's own native web tools** (Claude
`WebSearch`/`WebFetch`; whatever a future backend exposes). Owlery owns only
the part that was actually missing: **orchestration** — driving the fan-out as
many small, bounded sub-turns instead of one giant uncontrolled turn, with
progress, limits, cancellation, and persistence.

| Layer | Owner | Mechanism |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Web search + fetch | **the harness** | its native `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`, used inside a scoped sub-turn — §4 |
| Per-leaf work (search-an-angle / extract-claims / verify-a-claim) | a scoped harness **sub-turn** | a normal `HarnessRun` turn with `tool_allow` = web (+read-only) and a focused prompt — §5 |
| Pure reasoning leaves (scope decompose, final synthesize) | harness, agnostic | `harness.run_oneshot` (tool-free) — §5 |
| Orchestration (phases, fan-out, bounded concurrency, timeout, cancel, persist) | **Owlery (asyncio)** | `ResearchManager` + a pipeline — §6 |
| Invocation + progress + result delivery | Owlery | a built-in MCP tool + session injection, like bg/delegations — §7 |

Architecturally backend-neutral (no `if backend ==`; the orchestration only
ever calls `run_oneshot` and the generic `HarnessRun` turn API). Web
*capability* is **capability-gated** like fork's `can_fork`, but BOTH current
backends qualify (verified — §4): claude-code via `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`,
codex via its native `web_search` tool. A future backend with no web tools
simply doesn't offer research. We never build search ourselves.

## 3. Phases (mirrors the proven shape, orchestrated in Python)

1. **Scope** — one `run_oneshot` (tool-free) decomposes the question into 3–6
   angles (JSON, validated like schedule_ai's parse). No web needed.
2. **Search + gather** — one scoped **web sub-turn per angle** (parallel,
   semaphore-bounded): a `HarnessRun` turn allowed only the harness's web tools
   (+read-only), prompted to search the angle, read the best sources, and
   return a compact list of `{claim, url}` findings as JSON. The harness does
   the searching/fetching with its own maintained tools; we just collect text.
3. **Dedup + rank** — pure Python over the returned findings (no model, no web).
4. **Verify** — for the top-ranked claims, K independent web sub-turns each
   (adversarial "try to refute", web-allowed); majority-refute kills the claim.
5. **Synthesize** — one `run_oneshot` (tool-free) merges survivors into a cited
   report from the gathered `{claim, url}` set.

A single `asyncio.Semaphore` (config, default ~4–6) bounds ALL concurrent
sub-turns/oneshots so we never spawn the ~75-subprocess storm the CLI Workflow
did. Each phase reports progress (§7).

## 4. Web access — from the harness, never built here

Web search/fetch is the harness's job. A "leaf" that needs the web is a normal
Owlery `HarnessRun` turn (the same engine a chat turn uses), run in a
throwaway scratch context — not the user's session. Owlery reads the turn's
final text (JSON findings) and discards the sub-turn.

- **A dedicated leaf executor, NOT delegation child sessions** (Vera). Reusing
  delegations would drag in session persistence, child archival, broadcast
  capture, parent-chain/cycle rules, follow-up semantics and user-visible
  collaboration — all wrong for a stateless leaf. Instead a small leaf executor
  resolves the agent's credential/model once, runs a throwaway `HarnessRun`,
  captures the final assistant text, and returns structured `{text, cost,
  error}`.
- **The leaf does NOT inherit the session's `RunConfig`** (Vera). `_run_config`
  normally composes the agent's MCP set, connectors, memory dir, persona and
  tool policy (`session_manager.py:2082`), and `HarnessRun._make_context`
  always layers in the tools prompt + selected MCP servers (`run.py:171`). A
  web leaf must get an EXPLICIT minimal config: `mcp_servers=[]`,
  `connectors=[]`, no memory dir, a stripped system prompt, no resume id, a
  scratch cwd under the job dir, and `tool_allow` = the backend's web tools +
  read-only — so the leaf can't see bg/ask/ask_agent/connectors or durable
  memory instructions and cause side effects.

- **No provider, no API key, no extractor lib, no scraping** on our side —
  those are exactly the "way harder than it looks" problems we're declining to
  own. We inherit whatever quality/freshness the harness's web tools give.
- **Capability gate — a `WebCapability` object, not just a tuple** (Vera). A
  tuple of tool names under-specifies it. The profile declares a small
  `WebCapability`: the web tool name(s); how to ENABLE web (codex needs
  `-c tools.web_search=true`; claude needs nothing); whether tool restrictions
  are actually enforceable on this backend (see §1a — codex isn't yet); the
  native tool-event name(s) to watch in the stream; and whether fetch is
  separate (claude: WebSearch + WebFetch) or combined (codex: one `web_search`
  that searches+reads). Empty/None = no research on that backend, gated like
  `can_fork`. Verified against live CLIs: claude-code `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`;
  codex `web_search` (off by default — `codex 0.132 exec --json
  -c tools.web_search=true` emits a real `item.type:"web_search"` with cited
  results). The leaf prompt is written tool-agnostically ("use your web
  tools…") so one orchestration drives both shapes.
- **Bounding is mandatory here** — see §1a prerequisite 1.

## 5. Reasoning leaves via `run_oneshot`

The non-web leaves (scope decompose, final synthesize) are
`OneShotContext(prompt=..., model=agent.model, credential=<agent's resolved
credential>, working_dir=<scratch>)` → `run_oneshot`, parsed against a JSON
schema (reusing schedule_ai's extract-validate-retry helper). Tool-free and
backend-neutral, with the agent's own credential/model so cost attributes
correctly, bounded by `run_oneshot`'s timeout + the job timeout (§6).

## 6. ResearchManager (async job, like bg/delegations/scheduler)

A module singleton bound in `main.py`'s lifespan (mirrors `bg_task_manager`
/ `delegation_manager`). It:

- Starts a research job for `(session_id, question)`, returns a `research_id`
  immediately, runs the pipeline as a tracked `asyncio.Task`.
- Owns a **hard overall timeout** and an **idle/heartbeat** — the gap that let
  the CLI Workflow hang forever simply cannot happen here because we control
  the loop and never block on an unbounded external stream.
- Is **cancellable**: cancel reaps all in-flight `run_oneshot` subprocesses
  (we hold their `HarnessRun`s) and fetch tasks — no orphans (contrast the CLI
  Workflow, whose nested `claude` processes orphaned on interrupt).
- Persists to a `research_jobs` table, with **completion and delivery tracked
  separately** (Vera): `status`/`phase`/`completed_at` AND `injection_status`/
  `injected_at`/`delivery_error`/`report_path`. Because the report is delivered
  by queuing a `start_message` injection (§7), a job can be `completed` while
  its report still sits behind an active user turn — the card/DB must show
  "done, injection queued" distinctly from "delivered" to avoid confusing UI.
  Terminal injection is **idempotent** (like delegations' `_terminal_injected`).
  Cancellation is a **state transition recorded before** interrupting live work
  (mirrors delegation cancel ordering). A boot sweep marks running jobs
  `interrupted`/`failed`; v1 does NOT resume mid-pipeline.

## 7. Invocation + surfacing

- **Agent-initiated**: a new built-in MCP server `mcp__research__deep_research
  (question)` added to the default per-agent MCP set (alongside ask/bg/
  ask_agent; migration backfills existing agents). It's a thin HTTP shim to a
  `/api/sessions/{sid}/research` route, same env-injection pattern as bg/
  ask_agent. Returns immediately with `research_id`; the model's turn ends
  cleanly (no hang). This keeps invocation model-agnostic — the agent just
  calls a tool.
- **User-initiated**: a `/research <question>` slash command (like
  `/schedule`) → same route.
- **Progress**: phase transitions + counts ("Searching 5 angles…", "Gathered
  9 findings…", "Verified 18 claims…") broadcast as session events and rendered
  as a research progress card (a new card like the delegation/bg chips).
- **Result**: the final cited report is written to a `research/` file under
  the working dir AND injected into the session as a synthesized turn
  (`[deep-research:<id>] …report…`) via the same `start_message` path bg
  delivery uses — so the agent can read/act on it and the user sees it.
- **Cancel**: a cancel control on the card → route → `ResearchManager.cancel`.
- **Card lifecycle**: the card is a progress indicator, not a history log. A
  terminal job (completed/failed/cancelled/interrupted) lingers for
  `RESEARCH_LINGER_MS` (`ResearchCard.tsx`) so the user sees the outcome, then
  the component removes it from the store itself (`removeResearch`). The
  session-load / WS-reconnect snapshot (`GET /api/sessions/{sid}/research` →
  `list_research_jobs_for_session`) returns `running` jobs plus anything that
  went terminal within `_RESEARCH_SNAPSHOT_TERMINAL_WINDOW_SECONDS`
  (`database.py`) — wide enough to cover a client that reconnects shortly
  after missing the terminal WS broadcast (failed/cancelled/interrupted jobs
  have no transcript-message fallback the way a completed job's report does),
  narrow enough that a refresh well after the fact never resurrects an
  already-finished card. Browsing finished jobs beyond that window is a
  separate, unbuilt history feature.

## 8. Limits & safety

A per-job semaphore (~4–6) is necessary but **not sufficient** (Vera): add a
**global** concurrency budget across ALL research jobs (else N sessions each
start 6 leaves and exhaust the box) and a max-concurrent-jobs cap. Plus
phase-level caps: max findings per angle, max claims entering K-vote verify,
max retries per leaf, max report-input bytes. Other config: max angles,
verifier votes, per-sub-turn + per-oneshot + per-job timeouts, optional per-job
token/cost ceiling. Never hold the session's turn lock during a job; only touch
`start_message` for terminal injection. Web I/O limits (page size, rate) are
the harness's concern, not ours.

## 9. Testing

- Orchestrator: fake the leaf executor (both the web sub-turn and
  `run_oneshot` are injected callables — schedule_ai already shows the
  `runner=` seam) so the whole pipeline runs deterministically with no network
  or CLI; assert phase order, bounded concurrency, timeout abort, and
  cancellation reaping. Dedup/rank are pure-unit.
- Capability gate: a backend with no `web_tool_names` makes deep research
  return the clear unavailable message.
- Manager/routes/MCP tool: like the delegations/bg suites.
- Prerequisite coverage (Vera): codex `build_turn_argv` web-enablement +
  tool-restriction rendering; leaf-config isolation (no inherited
  MCP/connectors/memory); process-group reaping for `HarnessRun` *and*
  `run_oneshot`; global (cross-job) concurrency cap; queued terminal injection
  (job `completed` while injection pending → delivered) + idempotency; boot
  sweep marking interrupted jobs.
- Gated real-CLI test (one tiny real research run on claude-code) behind the
  `tests/cli_gate.py` "signed-in" gate.
- Frontend: research card states (running/phase/done/failed/cancel).

## 10. What this defers / explicitly out of scope

- **We never build or integrate web search/fetch** — no provider API, no
  scraping, no extraction lib. Web is sourced from the harness's native tools
  (§4); quality is whatever the harness gives.
- **Prerequisite, not deferred:** the generic per-turn watchdog / heartbeat /
  process-group reaping ("Layer 1"). Because each web leaf is a real harness
  turn, this feature must land on top of that safety net so a wedged leaf is
  bounded — it's what structurally prevents the original hang.
- Result caching across jobs, and non-text sources, are follow-ups once the
  core lands. (Codex web parity is NOT deferred — verified working via
  `tools.web_search`; both backends are supported from the start.)
