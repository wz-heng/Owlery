# Harness transient-error retry

## 1. Problem

Claude Code and Codex sometimes fail a turn for reasons that have nothing
to do with the user's request or their credit — the *provider's* backend is
briefly unreliable: HTTP 5xx, Anthropic "Overloaded" (529), a dropped/reset
stream, a gateway timeout. Today such a turn just surfaces as a failed
result and the user has to manually resend. These errors are transient and
usually clear within seconds, so the careful behavior is a bounded
automatic retry.

This is the sibling of harness-credential-reauth.md: same per-backend
pattern machinery, different disposition.

## 2. Three dispositions for a failed turn

A failed turn's error text (terminal event content/raw + the CLI's stderr)
is classified, in order, behind the harness contract:

1. **Auth-credential rejection** (401 / revoked / expired) →
   `Harness.is_auth_error` → flag the credential needs_reconnect and STOP
   (harness-credential-reauth.md). Never retried — re-auth won't fix itself.
2. **Transient backend error** (5xx / overloaded / dropped connection /
   timeout) → `Harness.is_transient_error` → bounded retry (this doc).
3. **Everything else** — including quota/credit ("rate limit", 429,
   "insufficient quota", billing) — surfaces as-is. Deliberately NOT
   retried: the user said "not my credit limit", and hammering a quota
   error wastes time and can worsen rate-limiting.

The classifiers are mutually exclusive by construction — `429` / "rate
limit" / "quota" appear in neither pattern set; auth phrases appear only in
the auth set.

## 3. Detection behind the harness contract

Mirrors the auth work (no `if backend ==` outside `server/harness/`):

- `RuntimeProfile.transient_error_patterns: tuple[str, ...]` — lowercased,
  auth-/quota-free, server-reliability phrases per backend.
- `Harness.is_transient_error(text) -> bool` — case-insensitive substring
  match; pure.

Patterns are specific server-reliability phrases ("overloaded", "internal
server error", "service unavailable", "bad gateway", "529", "connection
reset", "timed out", "stream error", …), chosen narrow because broad tokens
(a bare "unauthorized") cause false positives.

**Server-side throttle vs. the user's usage limit.** Anthropic emits a
server-side throttle as "Server is temporarily limiting requests (**not your
usage limit**) · Rate limited" — a transient blip that SHOULD retry, despite
containing "Rate limited". We must still NOT retry the user's *own* quota /
usage limit. So we match the throttle on its specific phrasing
("temporarily limiting requests", "not your usage limit") rather than a bare
"rate limit" / "429" (which also appears in the user's-limit message, and
stays non-retryable). This was a real miss: the bare-"rate limit" exclusion
swallowed the server throttle and stopped the turn instead of retrying.

## 4. Retry in the run loop (`session_manager._run_backend`)

The retry slots into the existing post-turn dispatch, BEFORE the
`saw_result` early-return (a transient failure arrives as an `is_error`
`result`, so `saw_result` is true) and the Claude premature-exit recovery:

- A turn is *failed* when it produced an `is_error` result/error event, or
  no result at all.
- On `is_transient_error(blob)`, retry after exponential backoff
  (`_TRANSIENT_RETRY_BASE_DELAY * 2**(n-1)`), bounded by
  `_MAX_TRANSIENT_RETRIES` (2), in one of **two modes**:
  - **No output yet** (`not saw_tool_use and not saw_text`) → re-run the
    ORIGINAL prompt, restoring the turn-start resume id (a failed no-output
    attempt may have captured a `session_started` id we must discard).
  - **Output already streamed** AND a resume id was captured → **RESUME with
    "continue"** from that id, so we pick up where the turn left off WITHOUT
    re-running tools or duplicating text.
  A discreet marker is persisted + broadcast each retry; on exhaustion (or
  output-without-a-resume-id) a clear error is surfaced.

**Why two modes (corrected).** The first cut gated retry on *no output yet* and
let a mid-turn throttle simply stop the session — but a long agent turn almost
always emits tool calls / text before being throttled, so that was the common
failure, not the rare one. Re-running the prompt after partial work would
duplicate it, so for that case we instead RESUME the conversation with
"continue" (the same mechanism as the premature-exit recovery) — bounded and
backed off — which recovers the turn safely. Re-running the original prompt is
reserved for the clean no-output case.

The backoff `sleep` is a normal `await` inside the turn, so a user interrupt
cancels it like any in-flight turn.

**Resume-id preservation.** A failed no-output attempt can still
emit `session_started` and mutate `session.claude_session_id`. Left alone, the
retry would become `--resume <failed-id> -- <original prompt>` — not the
original invocation, risking a duplicated prompt or a resumed dead partial
conversation. So the logical turn snapshots `resume_at_turn_start =
session.claude_session_id` before the loop and, on a transient retry, restores
it (memory + DB) before re-running. The premature-exit recovery is unaffected —
it deliberately resumes the captured id with "continue".

## 5. What this defers

- No retry after partial output (see §4 rationale) — surfaced, not retried.
- No retry of quota/rate-limit/credit failures (§2).
- Retry counts/backoff are module constants, not yet user-configurable.
