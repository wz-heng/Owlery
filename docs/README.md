# Owlery docs

Three kinds of docs live here. **Start with `architecture.md`** for how the
system works today; the rest is design history and reference.

## Current

- **[architecture.md](architecture.md)** — the current system design: harness
  layer, agents, sessions, backends, MCP tools, connectors, bridges, the
  WebSocket protocol, the data model, and key decisions. The doc to read first.
- **[connectors-setup.md](connectors-setup.md)** — user how-to for setting up
  GitHub / Gmail / custom OAuth connectors entirely from the browser.

## Design records — [`plans/`](plans/)

One plan per major initiative, written before/while it was built and kept as the
design rationale. **Code comments cite these by filename + section** (e.g.
`agent-refactor.md §5.5`), so treat them as living references, not throwaways.

- **[plans/agent-refactor.md](plans/agent-refactor.md)** — first-class Agents.
- **[plans/codex-backend.md](plans/codex-backend.md)** — the Codex backend.
- **[plans/connectors.md](plans/connectors.md)** — the connector framework.
- **[plans/memory.md](plans/memory.md)** — per-agent native memory.
- **[plans/harness-layer.md](plans/harness-layer.md)** — the one-harness,
  profile-per-backend runtime boundary.
- **[plans/agent-collaboration.md](plans/agent-collaboration.md)** —
  agent-to-agent delegation (the `mcp__ask_agent__*` tools). Reverses
  the explicit "no A2A" carve-out in `agent-refactor.md` §40-41.
- **[plans/durable-session-injections.md](plans/durable-session-injections.md)** —
  per-round delegation execution records plus the crash-safe, deduplicated
  session-injection outbox shared by delegation, bg tasks, and research.
- **[plans/task-board.md](plans/task-board.md)** — implementation task book for
  the multi-agent Task Board: boards, task tree + dependency DAG, durable runs
  and handoffs, dispatcher/worker lifecycle, workspace isolation, and Kanban UI.
- **[plans/task-git-delivery.md](plans/task-git-delivery.md)** — the Git
  delivery closure for Task Board `git_worktree` runs: change acceptance, commit
  ownership, at-most-once branch push / PR creation / optional safe merge,
  worktree teardown + retention, destructive-action guards, and crash recovery.
  Builds on `task-board.md` and `durable-session-injections.md`.
- **[plans/session-rewind.md](plans/session-rewind.md)** — `/rewind`
  (also `/tree`): branch a conversation to any prior user message, with optional
  git revert of the working tree. The conversation-rewind feature.
- **[plans/session-fork.md](plans/session-fork.md)** — `/fork`
  filesystem copy: duplicate the current session onto an independent full copy
  of its working directory.
- **[plans/turn-safety.md](plans/turn-safety.md)** — per-turn watchdog (idle +
  overall timeout) and process-group reaping so a wedged tool can't hang a
  session forever.
- **[plans/harness-credential-reauth.md](plans/harness-credential-reauth.md)**
  — reactive 401 detection: flag a bound credential as `needs_reconnect` on a
  mid-turn auth failure and surface a re-authorize affordance.
- **[plans/harness-transient-retry.md](plans/harness-transient-retry.md)** —
  bounded automatic retry on transient backend errors (5xx / overloaded /
  dropped stream), distinct from auth failures and quota errors.
- **[plans/native-deep-research.md](plans/native-deep-research.md)** —
  Owlery-orchestrated deep research: harness-agnostic fan-out of scoped
  web-search sub-turns with progress, cancellation, and synthesis.

## Reference notes

Research captured while reverse-engineering the CLIs' stream protocols and a
post-mortem on a tricky pipeline. Cited from code where relevant.

- **[cli-protocol-notes.md](cli-protocol-notes.md)** — the Claude Code CLI's
  `--print` stream-JSON protocol.
- **[codex-protocol-notes.md](codex-protocol-notes.md)** — the Codex CLI's
  `exec --json` event schema.
- **[cli-system-prompt-notes.md](cli-system-prompt-notes.md)** — observed
  system-prompt behavior.
- **[post-mortems/](post-mortems/)** — incident write-ups (kept here because
  code/tests cite them inline). Currently
  [`2026-05-18-bg-pipeline-hardening.md`](post-mortems/2026-05-18-bg-pipeline-hardening.md):
  post-mortem on four `mcp__bg__run` → model-turn pipeline bugs. Note: the
  `server/backends/*` paths it cites predate the harness refactor — that code
  now lives under `server/harness/`.
