"""REST endpoints for the MCP-based AskUserQuestion flow.

Three endpoints:

  POST /api/sessions/{id}/questions
      Called by the `ask` MCP server (server/mcp_servers/ask.py) when
      the model invokes `mcp__ask__user`. Body: `{questions: [...]}`.
      Owlery generates a question_id, persists the question into the
      session's chat history (so reload re-renders the form), and
      broadcasts the `question_request` WS event to the frontend.
      Returns `{question_id: "..."}`.

  GET  /api/sessions/{id}/questions/{question_id}/answer
      Long-polled by the ask MCP server. Blocks on an asyncio.Event
      until the user submits the answer (or the per-call timeout
      hits). Returns `{answer: "..."}` on success, or 408 on timeout
      so the MCP server can retry. The MCP server retries until it
      gets an answer or the session-level auto-answer timer fires.

  POST /api/sessions/{id}/questions/{question_id}/answer
      Called by the frontend when the user submits the form. Routes
      into session_manager.answer_question() which sets the Event
      that unblocks the long-poll, persists the answer, and
      broadcasts the question_answer WS event.

Auth: same bearer-token model as every other API surface. The MCP
server holds OWLERY_AUTH_TOKEN; the frontend sends the user's
bearer.

This replaces the previous CLI control-protocol path
(`--permission-prompt-tool=stdio` + deny-channel answer) that was
exposing us to the CLI's premature-exit bug at large context scale.
