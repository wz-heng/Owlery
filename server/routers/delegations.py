"""REST endpoints for agent-to-agent delegations (agent-collaboration.md).

Shape mirrors the bg-tasks router: a thin translation layer between
HTTP and the in-process `DelegationManager`. The `ask_agent` MCP server
(Phase 2) will POST to these endpoints from inside a running harness;
in Phase 1 the only caller is tests, by design.

All routes are session-scoped (`/api/sessions/{sid}/delegations`)
because a delegation always has a parent session. The delegation id
*is* the child session id — there's no parallel id space.

Auth: same bearer token as every other API surface.
