"""The `RuntimeProfile` — one data record per harness kind.

This is the heart of the data-driven design (VM0's `Record<framework,…>`
shape in Python): there are no `ClaudeCodeHarness`/`CodexHarness`
subclasses. There is one `Harness` class, one `HarnessRun` engine, and
two `RuntimeProfile` *values* (`CLAUDE_CODE` in claude_code.py, `CODEX` in
codex.py) that supply the few genuinely per-framework pieces — argv
rendering, event parsing, one-shot, login, transcript codec — as data +
small collaborators.

The shared `assembly.py` pre-computes the neutral inputs (selected MCP
servers, composed system prompt) into a `TurnContext`; the profile's
`build_turn_argv` only renders that into a concrete CLI command.
