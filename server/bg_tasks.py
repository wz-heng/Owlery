"""Cross-turn background tasks.

The model calls `mcp__bg__run(command, description?)` to fire-and-forget
a shell command. The MCP tool POSTs into this manager, which:

  1. Inserts a `bg_tasks` row (status=running)
  2. Spawns an asyncio.Task that runs the subprocess to completion in
     the FastAPI process — independent of any `claude --print` lifetime
  3. Returns the task_id to the model immediately, so the model's turn
     can end while the subprocess keeps running

When the subprocess completes (success / failure / cancel / timeout):

  4. The row is updated with exit_code + captured output
  5. A `bg_completed` WS event is broadcast (so the chip animates)
  6. A synthesized user_message is injected into the session via
     SessionManager so the model gets a turn to react to the result

Why a FastAPI-process worker instead of letting the SDK's Bash
run_in_background handle it: that bg lives inside the per-turn `claude`
subprocess and dies with it. We need a persistent owner.

Output capping: each stream is held at MAX_STREAM_BYTES; once exceeded,
we keep the *most recent* bytes and tag the row `truncated=True`. The
synthesized prompt explains the truncation so the model can ask the
user if it needs the head bytes.
