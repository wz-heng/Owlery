"""On-disk storage for user-uploaded session attachments.

Files live at:
    <attachments_root>/<session_id>/<attachment_id>__<sanitized_filename>

`attachments_root` defaults to `~/.owlery/attachments` and is configurable
via `OWLERY_ATTACHMENTS_DIR`. Filenames keep the original extension (so
the agent's `Read` tool picks the right handler), prefixed with a short
unique id so two uploads of `screenshot.png` don't collide.

Lifecycle: attachments live as long as their owning session row. When a
session is hard-deleted (`DELETE /api/sessions/{id}`), the per-session
directory is removed too. There's no separate orphan GC — anything
uploaded but never sent gets wiped when its session is deleted.
