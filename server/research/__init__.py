"""Owlery-native deep research (native-deep-research.md).

Owlery owns the fan-out orchestration; each harness's OWN native web tools do
the searching/fetching (we never build search). Backend-agnostic: the
orchestrator only ever calls `run_oneshot` (reasoning leaves) and a scoped,
isolated `HarnessRun` web sub-turn (web leaves) — no `if backend ==`.
