"""Agent-to-agent delegation manager (agent-collaboration.md).

The shape mirrors `server/bg_tasks.py`: an asynchronous, fire-and-forget
operation on the parent agent's behalf, whose terminal result is
delivered back to the parent session as a *new* injected user message
(routed through `SessionManager.start_message`, the same path bg-task
results use). That parent-injection is what gives the parent agent a
fresh turn to react to the child's reply.

For agent collaboration, the operation is "spawn a child Session under
another agent and run one turn there". A delegation is **not** a new
persistence concept — it is a normal `Session` row with
``origin='delegation'`` and ``parent_session_id`` set. The delegation id
*is* the child session id; we don't invent a parallel id space.

What this module owns:

  - The in-memory registry of live (and recently-finished) delegations,
    keyed by child-session id.
  - The broadcast subscriber that watches the child's event stream and
    captures the events that matter for delivery (the same filter
    bridges use for quiet mode: assistant_text + result + error).
  - The cycle and depth guards that walk the parent chain.
  - The agent-name lookup (case-insensitive, ambiguity-rejecting).
  - The injection formatter: ``[agent-reply|agent-error:<name>
    delegation=<id>]`` plus the body, fed through
    ``SessionManager.start_message(parent_session_id, …)``.

What this module does NOT own:

  - The ``ask_agent`` MCP server (Phase 2). The server is a thin
    stdio shim that POSTs to the FastAPI routes which call into here.
  - The caller-aware ``ask`` server (Phase 3) — that's a one-line
    change in the existing question handler.
  - Frontend rendering (Phase 4).

Phase 1 deliberately limits itself to: a real child Session is created
under the target agent, the child runs its first turn, and the reply is
injected back into the parent. The parent agent has no tool with which
to invoke this yet — only the REST API does.

        - Cycle: the target agent must not already appear in the chain.
        - Depth: the new delegation (counted as +1) plus all existing
          ``origin='delegation'`` hops in the chain must not exceed
          ``DEPTH_CAP``.

        Self-delegation (target == parent.agent_id) is rejected by the
        caller; this method still catches it transitively via the cycle
        check, but the dedicated error message at the call site is
        clearer for the user.

        Fail-closed semantics: a corrupted parent_session_id chain
        (loop in the session-id pointers, or a chain longer than the
        safety cap, or a non-null ``parent_session_id`` whose target
        the DB also can't find) is rejected as a 409 rather than
        silently treated as a valid (short) chain. The cycle guard is
        what stands between "Vera asks Octo" and an infinite
        delegation tower — it must never be skipped.

        Archived ancestors are allowed: when ``session_mgr.get_session``
        returns None for a non-null ancestor id, we fall back to the
        DB (``include_archived=True``) so that a legitimately archived
        delegation parent still contributes its agent_id / origin to
        the walk. This matters after the round-2 fix that archives
        delegation children once their terminal turn is delivered:

        the child + a `cancel_delegation` from the parent, or a
