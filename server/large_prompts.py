"""Spill oversize prompts to disk and hand the backend a pointer.

Linux's `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` ceiling (~128 KB / 32 pages) means `execve`
fails with `E2BIG` if any single argv element is larger. Owlery
passes the user prompt to `claude` as a positional argv after `--`
(the VM0 shape — see `docs/post-mortems/2026-05-18-bg-pipeline-hardening.md` §2),
so any prompt over the ceiling is unspawnable.

In the wild this fires most often on bg-task-result injection
(test-suite stdout, `cargo build` output, big greps), but it can
also trip on a user pasting a large block directly into the chat.

Strategy: any prompt whose UTF-8 size exceeds
LARGE_PROMPT_THRESHOLD_BYTES is written to a per-session spill file,
and the backend receives a small **pointer prompt** that tells the
model to `Read` the file in full before responding. The model's Read
tool supports offset/limit and Grep, so prompts much larger than the
model's own context window are still consumable — the model decides
what to ingest.

Lifecycle: spill files live alongside attachments and are wiped by
`delete_session_large_prompts(session_id)` when the session is
deleted.
