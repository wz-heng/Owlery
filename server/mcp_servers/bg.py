"""MCP stdio server: cross-turn background tasks.

The `bg` server exposes three tools to the model:

  - `bg_run(command, description?)` — start a fire-and-forget bg task,
    returns task_id immediately. Use this for anything that may take
    longer than ~30 seconds (long build, test suite, npm install) so
    the user's turn can end while the work proceeds. When the task
    finishes, Owlery auto-fires a follow-up turn into this session
    with the captured output.

  - `bg_cancel(task_id)` — SIGTERM a running bg task.

  - `bg_list()` — recent bg tasks for this session (most recent first).
    Useful on a resumed turn if the model needs to check the state of
    something it queued before.

Channel: this process is a child of the `claude` CLI, NOT of Owlery's
FastAPI server. We can't reach the BgTaskManager singleton directly —
we have to go over HTTP. The parent Owlery process injects three env
vars when spawning us:

  OWLERY_API_BASE     e.g. "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
  OWLERY_AUTH_TOKEN   the same bearer token everything else uses
  OWLERY_SESSION_ID   the session this CLI invocation is bound to

The session id is what scopes "this bg task belongs to that chat" — we
don't trust the model to pass it correctly, so it's not a tool
parameter.

    directory. Returns immediately with a task id; the command runs
    asynchronously and Owlery will inject a follow-up turn into this

    Use this for commands that may take longer than ~30 seconds (long
    builds, test suites, npm install, large fetches). For short
    commands (< 30s) use the regular Bash tool — bg has overhead from
    the follow-up turn and is not free.

    Args:
        command: The shell command to run. Executed under `/bin/sh -c`
            with cwd = session working_dir. Use full shell syntax
            (pipes, redirects, &&) freely. Subprocess output is capped
            at 200 KB per stream (truncated from start when over).
        description: Optional one-line label shown in the UI chip and
            in the follow-up turn (e.g. "running pytest"). The model
            should include this for any task it expects to outlast
            the current turn.
