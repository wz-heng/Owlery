"""MCP stdio server: agent-to-agent delegation (agent-collaboration.md).

The `ask_agent` server exposes four tools to the model. Their full
MCP names are `mcp__ask_agent__<tool>` (the prefix is the config key
under which the harness mounts this server, not the FastMCP server
name); inside this module the underlying Python functions are
``ask_agent`` / ``cancel_agent_task`` / ``answer_agent_question`` /
``list_agent_tasks`` and the ``@mcp.tool(name=…)`` decorators expose
the short forms ``ask`` / ``cancel`` / ``answer`` / ``list``.

  - `ask(request, name=…, delegation_id=…, files=…)` — bimodal
    delegation. Pass `name` to start a fresh delegation under a
    target agent; pass `delegation_id` to continue a prior
    delegation in the SAME child session (so the other agent keeps
    her in-session transcript across rounds — review iterations,
    "now apply that same review to file Y"). Exactly one of the two
    ids must be set. Returns a `delegation_id` immediately and ends
    the current turn; when the other agent finishes, Owlery
    auto-fires a follow-up turn into this session prefixed
    `[agent-reply:<name> delegation=<id>]` carrying the other
    agent's reply. The two modes were originally separate `ask` and
    `follow_up` tools; merged into one to keep the model's tool
    surface small (fewer per-turn-context tokens, one decision
    point instead of two).

  - `cancel` — best-effort stop a running delegation. Idempotent.

  - `answer` — answer a question a delegated agent raised via its
    own `ask` MCP tool. The other agent's pending question is
    drained with the parent's chosen label and the other agent
    resumes (agent-collaboration.md §5.5).

  - `list` — recent delegations from this session (most-recent
    first). Useful on a resumed turn to disambiguate multiple
    concurrent delegations by id.

Channel: this process is a child of the harness CLI (claude / codex),
NOT of Owlery's FastAPI server. We can't reach the DelegationManager
singleton directly — we have to go over HTTP. The parent Owlery
process injects three env vars when spawning us:

  OWLERY_API_BASE     e.g. "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
  OWLERY_AUTH_TOKEN   the same bearer token everything else uses
  OWLERY_SESSION_ID   the parent session this CLI invocation is bound
                       to (the delegation will be hung off this id)

The session id scopes "this delegation belongs to this chat" — we
don't trust the model to pass it correctly, so it's not a tool
parameter.

Shape mirrors `server/mcp_servers/bg.py` deliberately; the bg pattern
is the right shape for any cross-turn fire-and-forget operation whose
result is delivered as an injected follow-up turn.

    """Delegate work to another agent and wait — across turns — for
    their reply. Returns a delegation id immediately; the other
    agent's reply arrives as a follow-up turn into THIS session,
    prefixed `[agent-reply:<name> delegation=<id>]`.

    Two modes, picked by which id you pass:

    1) **Fresh delegation** — pass `name`. The other agent runs in a
       new child session with no context from this conversation; brief
       them in `request` as if they just walked into the room.

    2) **Continuation of a prior round** — pass `delegation_id` from a
       previous reply you got from the same agent. The other agent's
       earlier turn is still in her transcript, so she resumes with
       full context — ideal for review rounds, "now apply that same
       review to file Y", or any iteration on the same line of work.
       Don't repeat the original brief; just say what's new.

    Use mode (1) for unrelated work or **parallel fan-out** (multiple
    in-flight delegations to one target need separate sessions to run
    concurrently). Use mode (2) to save the other agent re-reading
    everything when you're continuing the same line of work.

    Exactly ONE of (`name`, `delegation_id`) must be set.

    Use this when the other agent is better placed to do the work
    (different skills, different tool access, a fresh context). Do NOT
    use it to offload work you can do yourself in this turn — the
    cross-turn round-trip costs latency and tokens.

    After calling, briefly tell the user what you asked and end your
    turn. When the follow-up arrives, relay or build on the reply.

    Args:
        request: What you want the other agent to do. For mode 1
            (fresh), write it self-contained: name files, paste
            snippets, spell out goals. For mode 2 (continuation), say
            only what's NEW — the original brief and the previous
            reply are already in the other agent's transcript.
        name: The other agent's display name (e.g. "Vera",
            "Researcher"). Required for mode 1. Case-insensitive;
            ambiguous matches are rejected.
        delegation_id: The id from an earlier reply (`[agent-reply:…
            delegation=<id>]`) to continue. Required for mode 2. The
            delegation must be in a terminal state — wait for the
            reply before continuing.
        files: Optional list of paths the other agent should read.
            Mode 1 only; ignored for continuations (the prior turn's
            file references are already in the transcript).

    Returns:
        A short string with the delegation id. Cite that id back to
