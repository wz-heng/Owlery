"""MCP stdio server exposing one tool: `user` (presented to the model
as `mcp__ask__user`).

Replaces the built-in `AskUserQuestion` tool, which Owlery formerly
intercepted via the CLI control protocol over stdio
(`--permission-prompt-tool=stdio` + a deny-channel hack to inject the
user's answer). That path was load-bearing for AUQ but exposed us to
a CLI premature-exit bug at large context scale (post-mortem in
`docs/post-mortems/2026-05-18-bg-pipeline-hardening.md` §2). The fix is to switch
the CLI to its VM0-style command shape (positional argv prompt, no
`--permission-prompt-tool=stdio`) and rebuild AUQ on top of an MCP
tool that uses regular HTTP to coordinate with the host.

Flow:

  1. Model calls `mcp__ask__user(questions=[...])`.
  2. This MCP server POSTs the questions to
     `/api/sessions/{id}/questions`, gets back a `question_id`.
  3. Owlery broadcasts a `question_request` WS event so the
     frontend renders the form (no shape change vs. the legacy
     path).
  4. This server long-polls
     `/api/sessions/{id}/questions/{question_id}/answer` with a
     60-second per-call window, looping until it gets an answer or
     the session-level auto-answer timeout fires.
  5. When the user (or the auto-answer) submits, the long-poll
     returns the rendered answer text; this server returns that text
     as the tool's result so the model can continue.

The tool's `questions` schema mirrors the built-in AUQ tool: each
question is `{question, header?, multiSelect?, options:[{label,
description}]}`. We don't validate exhaustively — the host re-
validates and the frontend renders whatever it gets.

Spawned by the harness as a child MCP server. Env injected by the harness
