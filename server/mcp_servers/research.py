"""MCP stdio server: native deep research (native-deep-research.md §7).

Exposes one tool, `mcp__research__deep_research(question)`, a thin HTTP shim to
the `/api/sessions/{sid}/research` route in front of `ResearchManager`. Like
bg/ask_agent, this process is a child of the harness CLI (not FastAPI), so it
calls back over HTTP using the injected env:

  OWLERY_API_BASE / OWLERY_AUTH_TOKEN / OWLERY_SESSION_ID

The job runs in the background; its final cited report is injected into THIS
session as a follow-up turn prefixed `[deep-research:<id>]`. So the tool
returns immediately — like bg/ask_agent, end your turn after calling it.

    """Run a deep, multi-source, fact-checked web-research job and get a cited
    report back — asynchronously.

    Owlery fans the work out itself (scope → parallel web searches → claim
    extraction → adversarial verification → synthesis) using THIS backend's
    own web tools, bounded and cancellable. The job runs in the background:
    this tool returns immediately with a research id, and when it finishes the
    cited report is injected into this session as a new turn prefixed
    `[deep-research:<id>]`. After calling, briefly tell the user you've started
    the research, then end your turn — the report arrives as a later turn.

    Use this for questions that need current, multi-source, verified
    information (not for things you already know or can read from the repo).

    Args:
        question: The research question. Make it specific — if it's vague
            (missing scope/constraints), ask the user to narrow it first,
            then pass the refined question here.

    Returns:
        A short string with the research id; the cited report follows later
        as an injected turn.
