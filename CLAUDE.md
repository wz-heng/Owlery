# Octopus Development Rules

## Do It Right The First Time (no MVPs, no future-polish)

**If we choose to do something, we do it perfectly — right now, in
this session.** No "minimal fix", no "MVP for now", no "we'll polish
this later". No deferral of cleanup to a "follow-up" item.

This rule is non-negotiable. Specifically that means:

- Never ship a half-done implementation and document the rest as
  "future work". If the full thing isn't worth doing right now, then
  don't start it at all.
- Never park the cleaner version in a "deferred work" note
  *instead* of doing it. Genuine deferrals (work that needs a real
  second use case, an external dep, or a user decision) belong in
  the relevant plan doc's §10 "What this defers"; nothing else is a
  legitimate place to stash "felt too long".
- Never add a comment like `# TODO: handle X properly later` or `#
  HACK: works for now`. If `X` matters, handle it in this change.
  If it doesn't matter, delete the comment.
- When the user asks "fix this", interpret it as "fix it the way a
  careful engineer with infinite time would" — not "ship the
  smallest patch that no longer crashes".
- "MVP" is not a status the user has to accept. There is no future
  in which a later session will go back and polish; in the AI era
  we have the bandwidth to do it right *now*, here, in one go.

This rule exists because past sessions repeatedly took the shortcut
and then had to be told to go back and do the real thing. Skip the
shortcut. Do the real thing the first time.

## After Every Code Change

You MUST verify your changes before considering them done:

1. **Backend unit tests**: `.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v` (903 tests; the
   real-CLI tests auto-skip unless their binary is on PATH —
   `test_backend_claude_code_real.py` + `test_schedule_ai_real.py` +
   `test_showme_ai_real.py` + the 2-hop / question-loop / 3-hop cases in
   `test_delegations_real.py` need `claude`; `test_backend_codex_real.py` +
   `test_codex_login_real.py` need `codex`; `test_agent_memory_real.py` +
   the claude→codex case in `test_delegations_real.py` need **both** —
   run with both binaries resolvable on PATH, see Conventions)
2. **Frontend unit tests**: `cd web && bun run test` (84 tests)
3. **TypeScript check**: `cd web && npx tsc --noEmit`
4. **E2E tests**: `cd web && bun run test:e2e` (67 tests, ~3.5 min, Playwright
   auto-starts servers). Split into two buckets for dev iteration —
   `bun run test:e2e:fast` (35 pure-UI tests, ~16 s — login / sessions /
   dialogs / sidebar / virtualized chat / attachments / etc.) and
   `bun run test:e2e:llm` (32 real-LLM tests, ~3 min — chat, /schedule,
   /showme, /archive, mcp__bg__run, AskUserQuestion, agent-collaboration,
   notifier, codex sign-in, handoff/pull). Anything that drives a real
   `claude` / `codex` turn carries `@llm` in its describe title; the
   `:fast` script uses `--grep-invert @llm`. Telegram bridge tests have
   their own config and run via `test:e2e:bridge`.

**Zero test failures are acceptable.** All tests must pass before committing. If a test fails, investigate and fix it — do not ignore, skip, or dismiss any failure as "flaky" or "pre-existing".

## Project Structure

- `server/` — Python backend (FastAPI)
- `server/cli.py` — CLI entry point (`serve`, `handoff`, `pull`)
- `server/database.py` — SQLite persistence layer
- `server/scheduler.py` — APScheduler-based recurring task runner
- `server/jsonl_parser.py` — Claude Code JSONL session parser
- `server/jsonl_writer.py` — JSONL writer for session export
- `server/routers/` — REST + WebSocket routers (`sessions`, `schedules`, `agents`, `credentials`, `connectors`, `delegations`, `research`, `ws`)
- `server/fork_helpers.py` — Pure helpers for session tree-rewind (`/rewind`): git-anchor capture at turn-start, side-effect classification over parent rows, safe-revert preflight + git-stash execution. Backend-agnostic and side-effect-contained.
- `server/research/` — Native deep research orchestration (`docs/plans/native-deep-research.md`): `ResearchManager` (async job lifecycle, phase pipeline, concurrency cap, cancel + reap), `orchestrator` (scope → search → dedup → verify → synthesize phases), `leaf` (throwaway `HarnessRun` sub-turns for web-search leaves and `run_oneshot` for reasoning leaves), `schemas` (JSON schemas for scope/findings/synthesis). Agent-invoked via `mcp__research__deep_research`; user-invoked via `/research <question>`. Result injected as a follow-up turn; a `ResearchCard` tracks progress in the UI.
- `server/mcp_servers/research.py` — Stdio MCP server exposing `mcp__research__deep_research(question)` to agents; thin HTTP shim to `/api/sessions/{sid}/research`. Returns `research_id` immediately so the model's turn ends cleanly.
- `server/bridges/` — Messaging-platform integrations (`telegram`, base + manager). A chat binds to an agent with a sticky session and a per-chat `verbose` flag (quiet by default → only the agent's natural-language replies, errors and approval prompts reach the chat; `QUIET_SUPPRESSED_EVENTS` hides tool calls/results/cost/status; `/quiet`+`/verbose` toggle it, persisted in `bridge_mappings.verbose`). `/sessions` renders a tappable inline-button picker (`send_session_list`) whose `switch:<id>` callback shares `BridgeManager.switch_session` with the `/switch` command
- `server/agent_manager.py` — Agent CRUD (durable assistant definitions that own sessions/schedules)
- `server/agent_memory.py` — Per-agent native memory (`docs/plans/memory.md`): one canonical markdown dir per agent (`<agents_dir>/<id>/memory/`), shared by both harnesses. Claude points its auto-memory at it via `CLAUDE_COWORK_MEMORY_PATH_OVERRIDE`; Codex via an injected `developer_instructions` blurb naming the dir (its native `features.memories` pipeline is unused — it doesn't run in headless `exec`). Memory is decoupled from both harnesses' config/auth dirs — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME` are never touched, so auth and `--resume` transcripts are unaffected. Pure path helpers + idempotent provisioning.
- `server/delegations.py` — Agent-to-agent delegation manager (`docs/plans/agent-collaboration.md`). Subscribes to the SessionManager broadcast bus; on a tracked child session's `assistant_text` / `result` / `error` / `question_request` events, captures + finalises and injects an `[agent-reply:<name> delegation=<id>]` (or `agent-question`, or `agent-error`) follow-up turn into the parent session via the same `start_message` path bg-task delivery uses. Cycle and depth-3 guards walk `parent_session_id`. `answer_pending_question(delegation_id, choice)` drains the child's oldest pending question on the parent's behalf — same Event-signal machinery the human UI uses (first to drain wins). The delegation id IS the child session id; no parallel id space, no new persistence table.
- `server/mcp_servers/ask_agent.py` — Stdio MCP server exposing the four delegation tools to the model: `mcp__ask_agent__ask` / `cancel` / `answer` / `list` (the Python functions are `ask_agent` / `cancel_agent_task` / `answer_agent_question` / `list_agent_tasks`; the `@mcp.tool(name=…)` decorators expose the short forms). `ask(request, name=…, delegation_id=…, files=…)` is bimodal: `name` starts a fresh child session, `delegation_id` continues a prior one in the same child transcript; exactly one id is required. Same `OCTOPUS_API_BASE` / `OCTOPUS_SESSION_ID` env-injection pattern as the bg + ask built-ins; thin HTTP shim to the `/api/sessions/{sid}/delegations` routes, including continuation via `/follow-up`. Added to the default per-agent MCP set; the migration backfills it onto every pre-existing agent row.
- `server/harness/` — Harness layer: the single boundary for all model/runtime interaction (`docs/plans/harness-layer.md`). One `Harness` class + one `HarnessRun` engine, configured by a `RuntimeProfile` *value* per backend kind (`claude_code`, `codex`) — no per-framework subclasses. Holds `assembly` (shared per-turn MCP/system-prompt assembly), `run` (subprocess+JSONL engine + PATH helpers), `registry` (`get_harness`/`available_backends`), `login` (LoginDriver protocol). Capabilities are derived from the profile; `run_oneshot` powers backend-agnostic `/schedule` parsing.
- `server/connectors/` — Connector framework: `base` (ConnectorBase + backend-neutral MCP entry), `oauth` (provider protocol + redirect-URI login manager), `registry`, built-in `github`/`gmail`, and `custom` (user-defined kinds + generic OAuth provider + `resolve_connector`)
- `server/connector_manager.py` — Connector business logic (install upsert, in-app OAuth-client config DB→env resolve, token-refresh lifecycle, custom-connector CRUD)
- `server/mcp_servers/connectors/` — Per-kind stdio MCP servers (`github`, `gmail`, generic `custom`) + shared token/truncation helpers
- `web/` — React frontend (Vite + TypeScript)
- `tests/` — Backend tests (pytest)
- `web/src/**/*.test.ts` — Frontend unit tests (vitest, colocated with source)
- `web/e2e/` — End-to-end tests (Playwright, auto-cleanup after runs)

## Commands

> **Frontend gotcha**: the backend serves `web/dist/` (the built SPA),
> not `web/src/`. Any source change needs `cd web && bun run build`
> before `octopus serve` / `uvicorn server.main:app` users will see it.
> For live HMR, run `cd web && bun dev` and hit the dev server's port
> (5173) instead of the backend.

```bash
# Backend
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v              # run backend tests
.venv/bin/uvicorn server.main:app       # start server (serves web/dist/)

# Frontend
cd web && bun run test                  # run frontend unit tests
cd web && bun run build                 # typecheck + build (refreshes web/dist/)
cd web && bun dev                       # live dev server on :5173

# E2E (Playwright)
cd web && bun run test:e2e              # run e2e tests (headless)
cd web && bun run test:e2e:ui           # run e2e tests with Playwright UI
cd web && npx playwright test --reporter=list  # verbose output
```

## Conventions

- Backend uses Python 3.12+, type hints, async/await
- Frontend uses React 19, TypeScript strict mode, zustand for state
- Use `useSessionStore.getState()` (not hook selectors) inside callbacks/effects that mutate store to avoid re-render loops
- The JS toolchain (`bun`, `node`, `npm`, `npx`) and `codex` install locations vary by machine (nvm under `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin`, or homebrew under `/opt/homebrew/bin` which is already on the default PATH). Confirm with `which bun` / `which codex`; only if a tool is missing from PATH do you need to manually prepend its bin dir (e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin:$PATH"`). The real-CLI tests (`test_backend_codex_real.py` etc.) need `codex` resolvable the same way (otherwise they error rather than skip)
